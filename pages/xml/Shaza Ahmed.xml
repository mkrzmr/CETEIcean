               <bibl>Mahmoud Mokhtar was an Egyptian sculptor born in 1891 and died in 1934.
                  He is considered one of the pioneers of modern Egyptian sculpture.
                  Mokhtar was known for his use of traditional Egyptian motifs in his work.
                  Some of his most famous sculptures include "Nahdet Misr" (Egypt's Renaissance) and "Sphinx of Giza".
                  Mokhtar's work helped to establish a new artistic identity for Egypt.
                  He remains an important figure in the country's cultural history <ref target="https://www.ucc.ie">lets try a link</ref>  </bibl>
